# terplugin
Plugin with widget that let admin / editor mark a post they would the recommend to see.

I have added checkbox columns in postlist, where the admin / editor can check / mark a post the would recommend the users / public to see.
It could be an old post, that the admin / editor would bring back to life.
I make a custom widget that show post at the font site / sidebar.

The widget shows posts.

The things I can`t figure out how to do is.

** Move a custom column to the posistion after the Title

** How I do the selection of post to show.
If a post has been checked in the "Recommandation" column in post list then this post gonna show in the widget at the front site.

** How I can change from text at the column heading to icon for this custom "Recommandation".
Maybe a star or a thumbs up.

** In line 180 in the ter-plugin.php I have said that I want to show 2 posts per page, but I only show one with featured image, title and published date, 
the other one is only showed with title.

The readme-file will be edited when the prosjekt is finished.
