Plugin with widget that let admin / editor mark a post they would the recommend to see.

I have added checkbox columns in postlist, where the admin / editor can check / mark a post the would recommend the users / public to see.
This column has a thumb icon.
It could be an old post, that the admin / editor would bring back to life.
I make a custom widget that show post at the font site / sidebar.

The widget shows posts, but not the right one.

The things I can`t figure out how to do is.

** Move the thumb column to the posistion after the Title, but before Author

** How I do the selection of post to show.
If a post has been checked in the "Recommend" column in post list then this post gonna show in the widget at the front site.
Then the post title and featured image gonna show up.

** If I checked / marked example 5 posts to recommend, I want them to show 20 sec each in the widget box. Like a carusell.

The readme-file will be edited when the prosjekt is finished.
